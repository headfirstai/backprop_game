        "# Escape Room: Predicting Passcodes\n",
        "You and your team are trying to escape from a room that is secured by a special \"smart lock\" that is designed to be challenging to crack. Instead of having a single passcode like most locks do, this lock changes its passcode over time! To break this lock, three correct guesses in a row are required.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lock displays a random sequence of numbers that changes every minute. Based on this sequence, it sets a new passcode. When this happens, your team has one minute to guess the passcode before it changes again.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the correct guess is entered, the lock will mark a tally (&#10004;) and display a new sequence. Three tallies will open the lock.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If an incorrect guess is entered, the tally will reset and the lock will show what the correct passcode was. One minute later, it will display a brand new sequence and your team is allowed to guess again.\n",
        "\n",
        "To escape from this room, you must learn how the lock generates its passcodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Clues\n",
        "Sounds tricky, right? Fortunately, your TA is an AI expert who studied this lock and noticed some patterns about how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The length of the display sequence never changes.\n",
        "- The passcode is always an integer (for example, 5, or -17).\n",
        "- Guesses that are close to the passcode (within a margin of +/- 3) are also counted as valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your TA also noticed that some numbers in the sequence seem to be more important than others, and suspects that the lock is using a simple \"linear combination\" to set the passcodes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It starts by creating a set of multipliers: random numbers that range from 1 to 9. There is one multiplier for each position in the sequence. These multipliers never change and remain the same even as the sequence changes.\n",
        "2. For every new sequence, it multiplies each number in the sequence by its corresponding multiplier.\n",
        "3. Finally, the lock sums up all the products to generate the passcode. It also adds a random small number (between -3 and 3) to make it harder to reverse engineer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose the lock always displays a sequence of length two. It starts by creating two multipliers as random numbers between 1 and 9. Let's say it chose 4 and 5. These multipliers are hidden and don't change for the duration of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if the lock displays a sequence of (1, 2), the passcode is calculated by first multiplying the sequence with the multipliers (4 * 1 + 5 * 2 = 4 + 10 = 14), and finally adding a small random number (14 + 1 = 15). Then, any guess from 12 to 18 will be accepted.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a minute elapses, the lock will generate a new sequence, say (-1, 3). The passcode is calculated with the same procedure on the new sequence, first by multiplying: (4 * -1 + 5 * 3 = -4 + 15 = 11), and adding a small random number to the sum: (11 + 2 = 13). Then, any guess from 10 to 16 will be accepted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your TA suggests that estimating the multipliers is the key to guessing the passcodes. To simplify the math, your TA has created a calculator that produces guesses based on the procedure above."
